# Basic-HTML-CSS-webdesign

The intent of this project is to demonstrate my ability to incorporate web frameworks and
third-party components into a web project by researching and reviewing documentation
independently. This project uses bootstrap 4 and google fonts.

It contains three responsive webpages,
- a home page (home.html),
- an about us page (aboutus.html) and
- a category page (category.html).


*Specification*


The header
- Bootstrap navbars are used for the account/basket/checkout navigation at the top of the
webpages and for the main navigation below the logo.
- Use bootstrap to right justify the account/basket/checkout navigation.
- The main navigation should use bootstrap collapsible navbar to show a hamburger icon at
the smaller screen widths. Clicking the hamburger icon should display the links vertically.
- Use bootstraps grid system to layout the logo, contact details and search. Allow 5/12’s of
the screen for the logo and tagline and 7/12’s for the contact details and the search. At the
smaller screen size these should appear underneath each other.
- Use bootstrap responsive floats (under bootstrap utilities on www.w3schools.com) to
display the contact details and the search to the right only above a particular width.
- Use a bootstrap input group for the search. The search button is a bootstrap button


The homepage
- Use a bootstrap carousel with captions
- Use the bootstrap grid system to align the features (Buy Online/Wedding Flowers/Corporate
Gifts). At the lower screen sizes these should appear underneath each other.
- Use bootstrap button

The about us page
- Use a bootstrap jumbotron with an image as the background

The category page
- Use a bootstrap card for each product.
- Use the bootstrap grid system to layout the category page. This page uses a nested grid.
- At medium sized pages and bigger the filter column takes 3/12’s of the page and the
products section (the main content) take 9/12’s. To layout the products use a
nested grid with each product card taking 4/12’s of the width – ie three cards per
row.
- At smaller page widths adjust the nested grid to display product cards two per row.
- At the extra small page width, the filter section appears above the products.
- Use bootstrap checkboxes for the filter
- Use bootstrap pagination
- Use bootstrap badges for the ‘new’ badge

Fonts
You are also required to choose two open source google fonts to implement on the webpages. One
font should be used for body text and one font should be used for headings. Choose fonts which suit
the content of the website. Choose fonts that are suitably different so that the headings stand out.
Ensure that the body text font is easy to read
